After infiltrating the freighter's cargo hold, the team finds a nuclear warhead covered in Arabic writing.

They are then ambushed and attacked by enemy fighters, but are able to narrowly escape before the ship sinks.
Examining the ship's manifest, they find it pointing to Al-Asad as the purchaser of the package containing the warhead.

Shortly after, the President of a Middle Eastern country, Yasir Al-Fulani, is captured and brought before Al-Asad and Zakhaev. 
Zakhaev hands Al-Asad a Desert Eagle handgun and he proceeds to use it to assasinate Al-Fulani, all infront of a broadcasting television camera.

Afterwards, Soap, Gaz, Price, along with Russian Loyalists led by the team's old friend Seargeant Kamarov set off to the Causcasus Mountains to rescue the Russian informnt who supplied them with the information about the cargo ship, Nikolai.

Meanwhile, Al-Fulani's death has caused the US Marine Corps or USMC to send in their 1st Force Recon team to the Middle East in search of AL-Asad.
Believing him to be broadcasting live from a TV station, they invade and clear out the building, but find no sign of him; Leaning that his broadcast was merely a recording meant to throw them off his trail.

Elsewhere, Bravo Team have successfully found and rescued their Russian informant, Nikolai, but while escaping, their helicopter is shot down.
Fleeing on foot, they are able to make their way to a second helicopter, thanks to friendly air support.

Back in the Middle East the 1st Force Recon team recover a tank, codenamed War Pig, and head to the capital city where they believe Al-Asad has fled to.
There they and informed of a nuclear warhead in the area.
As they prepare to evacuate, however, their escort is shot down.
They go back to rescue her, but unfortunately they aren't able to escape in time.
As their helicopter lifts off, the nuclear bomb is detonated, killing the team along with all of the other servicemen in the area.

One member of the team, named Griggs, survives the event, as he was separated from the team at the time of the blast.

Nikolai, the Russian informant, then  tells price abot Al-Asad's safehouse in Azerbaijan.
The SAS infiltrate and find Al-Asad where he's hiding before capturing him.
Price proceeds to interrogate him, but Al-Asad refuses to reveal who supplied the nuclar device.
Suddenly, the captured commander's phone rings and Price answers it to head Imran Zakhaev on the other end.
With this knowledge gained and his usefulness gone, Price then executes Al-Asad.

Price proceeds to tell his team about his history with Zakhaev.
As it turns out, fifteen years prior, Price was assigned to assassinate Zakhaev on a Mission with his commanding officer Captain MacMilan.
However when attempting to kill Zakhaev from a distance with a sniper rifle, Price's shot missed his mark, only managing to sever Zakhaev's arm.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203536889-5bc94ccd-039f-4ad6-8a91-99ee05afe72f.png)


Expecting him to die of blood loss, Price and his captain evacuated, but not before MacMillan injured his Leg, which prevented him from walking and forced Price to carry him out to safety.
Afterward, a joint mission between the SAS, USMC, and the Russian Loyalists is conducted to try and capture Zakhaev's son, Viktor, in order to gain intel to lead them to his father.

During the mission, Victor is located, and eventually cornered on top of a building.
Just before Soap can restrain him, however, Viktor escapes on a standby helicopter which is later shot down by Soap.

Angered by the death of his son, Zakhaev threatens to launch a nuclear attack if the United States and British forces don't immediatly leave Russia.
To stop this, Price leads a join British-American operation to retake Zakhaev's nuclear launch facility. 
After invading the facility, however, the team sees two nuclear missiles launch en route to the United States, with a potential of killing over 40 million civilians.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203537433-3a5ca8e6-9d0c-4ba2-a949-a86f081b796d.png)


The group the rush to reach ther control center, where Soap is able to use abort codes provided by command to destroy the missiles in flight and prevent the attack.

Zakhaev escapes from the nuclear launch facility, and Soap's team reach a vehicle depot, making their escape using Russian trucks.
Followed by enemy vehicles, the team escape down a Russian motorway, where an oil tanker explodes, leaving everyone except Griggs incapacitated.

Griggs drags Soap to safety, but is shot by Zakhaev's guards in the process, killing him.

Zakhaev then arrives and kills Gaz, before Price is able to throw Soap his gun.

Soap then takes aim and shoots Zakhaev and his guards, finally killing the Ultranationalis leader.

Kamarov and the Russian Loyalists arrive shortly after, and they proceed to take Soap and Price back to safety.
The media then arrives and the Russian officials cover up the entire accident, stating it was merely a series of nuclear tests.

At some later point, a special forces group including resources from various branches of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom,
and Australia.
This group is then given the name "Task Force 141".

By 2013, the Ultranationalists have successfully seized control of Russia and Zakhaev has since become seen as a martyr by the group.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203542642-f1e824da-83eb-4fe9-abbc-d9be3fb4e472.png)

Their new leader has also started staging various terrorist attacks against Europe.
Task Force 141 then executes a mission, "Operation Kingfish" to find and capture this new leader.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203542903-d0041894-c175-49e1-b7e4-4adb5582b131.png)


Bravo Team, led by Price infiltrates Kingfish's compound but finds no sign of him. 
Instead, they only discover that he's personally targeting the group before they spot a bomb planted as a trap.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203543061-4afb451a-9528-4877-9954-f673fee379c4.png)

They are able to escape, but as they're extracted by the helicopter, Price is forced to stay behind to provide cover fire to ensure their safe exit.
As they leave, he is struck by enemy fire and is captured by the Ultranationalist forces.

After returning from the mission, Soap is debriefed by General Shepherd.
Soap demands to know the identity of Kingfigh, and he's revealed to be one of Imran Zakhaev's former Lieutenants: a man named Vladmir Makarov.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203543455-296867ee-bfbb-4af9-a800-39ee4e780f01.png)

Sometime later, Task Force 141 sends a team to rescue a hostage V.I.P. from an airplane mid-flight.
this mission proves to be a success, as the hostiles are incapacitated, the hostage is rescued, and the team jump out safely before a bomb explodes, destroying the aircraft.

In August of 2016, US Army Ranger Joseph Allen works with his Sergent, Foley, on a mission in Afghanistan.
After an impressive performance, Allen is hand-selected by General Shepherd to be reassigned to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where his new mission is to go deep undercover and join Makarov's ranks.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203549967-9518219d-e88c-498e-98e9-fbfe18233e1a.png)

Meanwhile, the SAS sends Task Force 141 members Soap MacTavish and Sergent Gary "Roach" Sanderson to recover an Attack Characterization System module from a downed satellite at a Russian airbase.

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203552893-8d10286a-2763-4fa2-894d-bbbc046e83df.png)

During the mission however, the two are discovered and attacked by enemy forces.
The pair are able to fight through the enemy forces, finding snowmobiles which they use to escape with the module.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203553387-d8bee63a-b79f-4be8-bfc1-b2afea27fef1.png)

Later, Allen, having joined Makarov's ranks, participates in a massacre of civilians in a Moscow Airport.
Makarov instructs his crew to speak English and use NATO weapons to falsify a narrative to the Russians hat this was an attack on them by Americans.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203553732-0598a1ac-2132-4713-b6fe-3ba8681410b8.png)

As they escape, Makarov kills Allen, revealing that he had known the CIA operative's true identity all along. 
Makarov and his men then leave Allen's body behind, where it is identified as American.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203553857-32872642-45cd-41ac-bfb7-86bda49c82ca.png)

Shortly after, Task Force 141 learns of an arms dealer named Alejandro Rojas who has ties to Makarov.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203672297-2d50c87f-4020-4418-a8a0-f9b0014aca75.png)

Hoping to use him to get to the Ultranationalist leader, Roach, Soap, and Ghost chase him down and capture him, taking Rojas into their custody.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203672436-8b16b317-046d-4512-85cf-e602ef51ce00.png)

In retaliation to the percieved United States attack on the Moscow Airport, Russia launches a surprise attack on the United States, revealing that the ACS module Soap and Roach retrieved was compromised since its recovery.

The invasion eventually proves to be the catalyst for World War III.
Army Rangers Sergeant Foley, Corporal Dunn, and Private James Ramirez (Allen's replacement) are then sent to defend Washington DC.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203673361-82ec8457-479d-4909-bf9f-dd15439fc258.png)

Meanwhile, Task Force 141 learns from Rojas that the Russians are holding one of Makarov's most hated enemies in a gulag, whom they codename Prisoner 627.


General Shepherd, convinced that breaking out Prisoner 627 will draw out Makarov, sends Task Force 141 to the gulag hilding the prisoner to break him out.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203673430-4883678b-d598-4c7d-b5fa-4c9a2bf87798.png)

Once they infiltrate the gulag and fight through its security forces, they find that this prisoner is none other than Captain John Price

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203673496-422700eb-9cf4-4631-ab47-b532f6077b7c.png)

After a short reunion, Task Force 141 escapes with price by helicopter as the gulag is demolished below them.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203673553-a61c9570-0568-4d9b-9490-a6d977da8254.png)

In DC, Sergeant Foley and his team discover that the Air Force intends to carpet bomb the Capital Building believing it to be lost to the attacking Russian forces.

Meanwhile, Price agrees to immediately get back to work with Task Force 141.
Believing that something extreme must be done to stop the attack in the United States, Price plans to infiltrate a Russian nuclear submarine base. 
While Shepherd commands him to focus on fiding Makarov, Price cuts his communication and leads Task Force 141 to the submarine base instead.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203675693-a208814e-c854-4fd3-89a4-6c7fd74d2418.png)

There, Price, acting alone, hijacks the sub and launches a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile towards the east coast of the United States.
While the ICBM is in the air, the United States Secretary of Defense authorizes General Shepherd to do everything necessary to take down Makarov, providing a "blank check" for whatever he needs. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118233494/203676303-7cd444ab-da92-426e-acb0-14f99b13a0c8.png)

As the ICBM is in the atmosphere above Washington DC, Price has it detonated sparing Washington from the attack but destroying the International Space Station (ISS).

This blast creates an electromagnetic pulse, disabling all electronic equipment in the area, effectively stopping both US and Russian militaries in their tracks.
This distraction allows Sergeant Foley and his Rangers to retake the White House and set off emergency flares on the roof just as the fighters arrive, indicating that the city is in-fact not lost and calling off the airstrike.

The next day, Task Force 141 is informed of two possible locations about where Makarov has been hiding
